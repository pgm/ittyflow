ittyFlow is a simple, and experimental framework for creating workflows 
and/or "pageflows" in Java.   It was developed to solve similar problems as  
as jBPM and Spring Web Flow.   However, this was an experiment to achieve
those goals while making the framework very lightweight.

It is sufficiently incomplete that I would still call it an experiment at
this point, however, I think an application could be built on it.

The "docs" directory contains slides from an informal presentation I gave 
outlining the model and the underlying concepts.
